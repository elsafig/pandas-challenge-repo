Analysis of sample data from the district-wide standardized test results

Instructions
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

Hint: Check out the sample solution called PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb located in the .zip file to review the desired format for this assignment.

xDistrict Summary
Create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame, including the following:

x Total schools

x Total students

x Total budget

x Average math score

x Average reading score

x % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

x % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

x % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

xSchool Summary
Create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school, including the following:

x School name

x School type

x Total students

x Total school budget

x Per student budget

x Average math score

x Average reading score

x % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

x % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

x % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

x Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Create a DataFrame that highlights the top-5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

x School name

x School type

x Total students

x Total school budget

x Per student budget

x Average math score

x Average reading score

x % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

x % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

x % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

x Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Create a DataFrame that highlights the bottom-5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

x School name

x School type

x Total students

x Total school budget

x Per student budget

x Average math score

x Average reading score

x % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

x % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

x % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

x Math Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

x Reading Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

o Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student). Use your judgment to create four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending. Include the following metrics in the table:

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

o Scores by School Size
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

o Scores by School Type
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on school type (district or charter).
