Percentage of students passing both reading and math varies drastically from school to school from 50’s – 90’s.  
Top vs Bottom Performing Schools
Shows that Charter schools are more successful over district schools. Better performing schools tend to have a smaller student population.
Scores by Grades 
Shows that schools are about 50/50 for improving or not from grade 9 to grade 12 in both math and reading.
Scores by Spending 
Shows that bigger budget is not indicative of student success.
Scores by Size & Scores by Types
Reinforces our conclusions found in the top and bottom performing school tables. They show that schools with smaller student populations have a higher percentage of students passing both math and reading. As well as Charter school student perform better than students who attend District schools.

Two Conclusions from calculations:
1. Schools with smaller student populations and smaller budgets perform better overall than schools with large populations of students and more spending per student.  
2. Charter school student perform better than students who attend District schools.
